Comparing implementations of domain-specific languages utilizing language workbenches has been done by the Language Workbench Challenge.
Over three years, each year, the participants were challenged to realize a given domain-specific language with their language workbench \cite{erdweg2013state}

Domain-specific languages were also implemented with the Rascal language workbench in \cite{van2011rascal} and the Spoofax language workbench in \cite{kats2010spoofax}.
A typed version on top of Racket was developed using Racket itself in \cite{tobin2011languages}.
Other research in implementing languages, with Template Haskell, is described in \cite{mainland2007s}.
Extensions for the Java language are implemented with MPS in \cite{pech2013jetbrains}.
