\chapter{Introduction}

Developing domain-specific languages (DSLs) accompanied by appropriate tools involves a great deal of expense.
Language workbenches provide tools for languages-oriented programming, which can significantly reduce the amount of work to be done.
Another approach is the use of an embedded domain-specific language (eDSL), where the tools of the host languages can be reused.
