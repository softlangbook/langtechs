\chapter{Introduction}

Developing domain-specific languages (DSLs) accompanied by appropriate intergrated development environment (IDE) involves a great deal of expense.
Language workbenches try to reduce the burden on programmers by providing software development tools for language oriented programming (LOP).



Another approach is the use of an embedded domain-specific language (eDSL), where the tools of the host languages can be reused.
